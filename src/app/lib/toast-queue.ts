/**
 * The toast queue: the "Setting saved" confirmations and the app's notices ("Exported …",
 * "Saved …"). They float over the page instead of taking a line in it, because a line that
 * appears above the content pushes everything under it down, and back up when it goes. Settings
 * write on every keystroke of a radio or switch, so the queue has to survive a burst: three flicks of the same switch inside a second must read as
 * three confirmations, not one flickering box, and must not grow without end either.
 *
 * Kept pure and separate from the component so the capping and expiry rules can be tested without
 * a DOM — the timers themselves live in `useSavedToasts` (./use-saved-toasts.ts).
